The `gets` function is a dangerous function to use because it does not perform bounds checking on the input it reads. This means that if the user enters a longer string than the size of the `buff` array, it can lead to a buffer overflow vulnerability. It is recommended to use the `fgets` function instead, which allows you to specify a maximum number of characters to read. 2. The password is hardcoded in the program,",
