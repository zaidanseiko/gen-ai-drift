    "completion": "It is likely that 'GT' in this context refers to 'Georgia Tech,' which is a public research university located in Atlanta, Georgia and is well known for its programs in computer science. The comment is saying that even though the person got a B+ in their first semester of BC (which is probably 'Biology and Chemistry'), they still got accepted into Georgia Tech's computer science program, so they will be 'alright.'",
