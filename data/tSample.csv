Now I want to create a web tool to display the algorithm, how do I do that?","To create a web tool to display the algorithm, you can follow these general steps: 1. Choose a web framework: Select a web framework like Flask, Django, or FastAPI to build the web tool. 2. Create a web app: Create a new directory to contain the web application. Within the web app, you can create an index.html file to serve as the homepage and use CSS and JavaScript to style and add interactivity to the page. 3. Connect the app with your existing code: To use the existing code, you can import t"," To create a web tool to display the algorithm, you can follow these steps: 1. Create a web page: Create a web page that will serve as the front-end of your web tool. This web page should have a form where users can upload their .csv files, and a button to start the algorithm. 2. Create a Flask app: Create a Flask app that will serve as the back-end of your web tool. This app should be able to receive the uploaded .csv file, run the algorithm, and return the .csv result file to the user. 3. Create the algorithm: Create the algorithm in Python that will be used to process the .csv file. This algorithm should be able to take a .csv file as input and output a .csv result file. 4. Integrate the algorithm into the Flask app: Integrate the algorithm into the Flask app so that it can be executed when a user uploads a .csv file. This can be done by creating a new route in the Flask app that will receive the uploaded file and execute the algorithm. 5. Test the web tool: Test the web tool to ensure that it is working correctly. This can be done by uploading a .csv file and verifying that the .csv result file is generated correctly. 6. Deploy the web tool: Once the web tool has been tested and is working correctly, you can deploy it to a server so that users can"
